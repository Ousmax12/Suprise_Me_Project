Since we are about to make an ai that can understand ... i by that i mean really understand the meaning of the words
i though of an approach ... its a bit hard but not impossible 
          First ... as u said .... u define a verb as an action ... an order and a command
          That mean the AI should be able to undetstand the integrety of the word Inside and outside
          As a verb "type of word" and as the meaning "the consequence of the command"
          To do so .... u should go back ... to the low programming languages .... and by that ... i mean ... transform the Word
          the verb directly into a command .... AKA make a direct link between englsih and binary ....
          With that said ... it means Kinda making a whole programming language .... but not really becuz that will be just the 
          Input part of what i said before *SORA TEMP* ... Since ur familliar with python why dont u take it from this approach .
          If the AI will be linked to a phisical robot ... that mean it ll be more complicated ... since u have to make a link for 
          every single verb in the language 
          but as far as i know ... if its on a screen ... there isnt much an AI can do in that box ... so it should be relatively
          easy to do so.
          
          
          /* thats one idea ..... take a look ... then tell me what u think */
